# Mutt Community

## What is it?

A list of every fork and patch for mutt.

I searched through https://github.com/ and https://bitbucket.org/ for anything
called "mutt".  There were over 700 matches.  Many repositories were nothing
to do with mutt and many more were just people's mutt config files.

The remainder, I examined to determine if there was any unique code that I
should consider.

## Why?

To reduce the amount of wasted time and effort for mutt developers.

Mutt development is very conservative and consequently very slow.
This has driven a **lot** of people to fork mutt and roll their own versions.

The mutt community needs rallying around a single point and I'd like this
github team to be that point.

## What's Obsolete?

Many mutt patches don't have an official author/owner/maintainer.  They float
around the net in multiple forms.  Each patch applied to our development repo
will also reference a list of other patches that it obsoletes.  These obsolete
patches will be monitored to ensure any new development isn't missed.

This will simplify the job of future developers.
